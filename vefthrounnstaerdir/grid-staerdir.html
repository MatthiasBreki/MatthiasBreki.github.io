    <aside class="vinstri"><h4>Two headed boy
        All floating in glass
        The sun it has passed
        Now it's blacker than black
        I can hear as you tap on your jar
        I am listening to hear where you are
        I am listening to hear where you are
        Two headed boy
        Put on sunday shoes
        And dance round the room to accordion keys
        With the needle that sings in your heart
        Catching signals that sound in the dark
        Catching signals that sound in the dark
        We will take off our clothes
        And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
        And when all is breaking
        Everything that you could keep inside
        Now your eyes ain't moving
        Now they just lay there in their climb
        Two headed boy
        With pulleys and weights
        Creating a radio played just for two
        In the parlor with a moon across her face
        And through the music he sweetly displays
        Silver speakers that sparkle all day
        Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
        And in the dark we will take off our clothes
        And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
        Two headed boy
        There is no reason to grieve
        The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
        Left beneath christmas trees in the snow
        And I will take you and leave you alone
        Watching spirals of white softly flow
        Over your eyelids and all you did
        Will wait until the point when you let go</h4></aside>
    <main class="adal"><h4>What a beautiful face
        I have found in this place
        That is circling all 'round the sun
        What a beautiful dream
        That could flash on the screen
        In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
        Soft and sweet
        Let me hold it close and keep it here with me
        And one day we will die
        And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
        But for now we are young
        Let us lay in the sun
        And count every beautiful thing we can see
        Love to be
        In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me
        What a curious life we have found here tonight
        There is music that sounds from the street
        There are lights in the clouds
        Anna's ghost all around
        Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
        Soft and sweet
        How the notes all bend and reach above the trees
        Now how I remember you
        How I would push my…

    <article class="haegri"><h4>Daddy please hear this song that I sing
        In your heart there's a spark that just screams
        For a lover to bring a child to your chest that could lay as you sleep
        And love all you have left like your boy used to be
        Long ago wrapped in sheets warm and wet
        Blister please with those wings in your spine
        Love to be with a brother of mine
        How he'd love to find your tongue in his teeth
        In a struggle to find secret songs that you keep wrapped in boxes so tight
        Sounding only at night as you sleep
        And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying,
        As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet,
        Rings of flowers 'round your eyes
        And Ill love you for the rest of your life when you're ready
        Brother see we are one in the same
        And you left with your head filled with flames
        And you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth
        Push the pieces in place
        Make your smile sweet to see
        Don't you take this away
        I'm still wanting my face on your cheek
        And when we break we'll wait for our miracle
        God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
        When we break we'll wait for our miracle
        God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life
        Two headed boy she is all you could need
        She will feed you tomatoes and radio wires
        And retire to sheets safe and clean
        But don't hate her when she gets up to leave
